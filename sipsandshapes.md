# Purpose of the study
The Sips and Shapes Study (sometimes abbreviated "SASS") is conducted by researchers at the University of Missouri (MU) with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The purpose of this study is to increase understanding of factors that can lead to alcohol and other drug use-related problems in some people (MU Institutional Review Board [IRB#]).  More specifically, this research has two goals. The first goal is to explore how the brain's processing of a visual stimulus changes as a result of new experiences with that stimulus (e.g., when we learn that it predicts drug or food reward). The second goal is to explore if between-person differences in learning-related changes in how the brain processes a visual stimulus are related to between-person differences in the use of alcohol and/or other drugs. We hope that the insight we gain from this study will improve our understanding of factors that might put people at risk for developing problems with alcohol or other drugs, or that might protect people from developing such problems.

# Study Structure

## Part 1: Laboratory Visits

### Lab Visit #1 (Pre-Learning)
Visit the researcher's lab on the MU campus in Columbia, MO to undergo electroencephalogram (EEG) recording ("brain waves") and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning ("brain pictures") to see how and where in your brain various visual stimuli are processed. This lab visit will last ≈3 hours.  You will be compensated $60 in cash for this lab visit.

### Lab Visit #2 (Learning): 
Return to the researcher's lab to complete a computerized learning task in which you are presented in various visual stimuli, some of which predict receipt of a liquid reward containing alcohol or sugar. During this visit, you will also complete questionnaires about your feelings and provide breath samples to track changes in breath alcohol level. The amount of alcohol served will be equivalent to 1-2 standard drinks (e.g., re consumed over a 1 hr period. The amount of sugar served will be equivalent to an 8-oz. glass of fruit juice. This lab visit will last ≈4 hours to make sure you are sober before you leave.  You earn $80 .

### Lab Visit #3 (Post-Learning):
This visit to the researcher's lab needs to take place the day immediately after lab visit #2. It will be a repeat of lab visit #1. You can earn $60. 

**If you complete lab visits #1, 2, and 3, you earn a $40 "streak" bonus**

## Part 2: Post-Lab Online Check-in Surveys
- At 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after lab visit #3, you complete an online survey (≈15 min).
- You earn $10 per survey.
- If you complete the survey the day it is sent to you, you earn $10 extra.
- If you complete all 4 surveys, you earn a $30 "streak" bonus.

### Enrollment Status
Enrollment will open mm/dd/yyyy.

### Meet the research team:

<picture> Dr. Roberto Cofresí is the lead researcher for this study. Roberto is in charge of making sure everyone helping him is well trained and that all research study-related procedure are done right. He feels strongly that research participants should not only feel safe and comfortable in the lab, but also that they realize how important their contributions are. Since Dr Cofresí is a new professor, he will be mentored/supervised by two senior professors with over 30 years' experience doing research studies like this one: Dr. Bruce Bartholow (<LINK OUT>), a social cognitive neuroscientist with expertise in alcohol and EEG; and Dr. Brett Froeliger ((<LINK OUT>) a cognitive neuroscientist with expertise in nicotine and MRI.

(quote from robert somewhere: "Science is a team-effort, and participants are part of the team!")

<picture>  YYYYYY is the lead research assistant/coordinator for this study. He/she will help Dr. Cofresí with participant and room/lab equipment scheduling and communications. He/she also will be running some of the lab visits with Dr. Cofresí.
