		<h3>Roberto (Research Director)</h3>
<span class="image left"><img src="assets/images/members/roberto_cofresi1.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
		<p>Dr. Roberto Cofres√≠ is an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Missouri - Columbia. His undergraduate and graduate training in Biochemistry and Neuroscience, respectively, were completed at the University of Texas - Austin. Roberto is interested in  bidirectional translation between rodent and human neuroscience laboratories studying addiction-related learning and memory. The goal of his research is to understand why and how naturally learned signals (cues) for drugs of abuse like alcohol are able to capture attention, impel approach, and promote over-consumption in some of us but not others.

		<p>Ms. Elizabeth Conley is an undergraduate student double-majoring in Physics and Electrical Engineering with an interest in pursuing graduate training in cognitive neuroscience. Liz has been working with Dr. Cofresi since Fall 2021 to learn more about the neuroscience of addiction. She has helped design and develop the lab's intra-oral liquid stimulus delivery systems, including several prototype  mouthpieces. She also has learned how to collect and analyze EEG and functional NIRS data from human participants.</p>
