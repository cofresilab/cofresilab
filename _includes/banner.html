  <p><strong>  We use psychophysiological methods, especially EEG and fMRI, to study and localize the neurocognitive correlates of reward learning and memory as well as reward anticipation and consumption, including the post-ingestive consequences of drugs like alcohol.</p>

<p>While our current work is entirely in human, our research is informed by preclinical non-human animal model-based neuroscience frameworks and theories. Ultimately, we aim to translate and verify basic and intervention-related findings from preclinical addiction neuroscience laboratories into the human laboratory and bridge the gap to clinical applications and testing.</p>

<p>A current major research goal of the lab is to delineate the role of conditioned cue reactivity and incentive salience in eating, drinking, and drug use with a focus on alcohol use.</p>

<p>Our research is funded by the NIH (the National Institutes of Health) National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA).</p></strong>
