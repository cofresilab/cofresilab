Despite great strides made in our scientific understanding of alcohol addiction over the past 50 years, the number of people affected by alcohol misuse remains alarmingly high: according to the (2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health)[https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-use-disorder-aud-united-states] in the U.S., over 29 million people ages 12 and older had an alcohol use disorder (AUD). 

Decades of work in preclinical non-human animal models of AUD-relevant phenotypes have identified behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that may drive the development of AUD or contribute to AUD relapse as well as potential interventions on those mechanisms, but their relevance to the human condition remains unclear. Translating and testing findings from preclinical models in humans is critical to establishing the relevance of those theorized neurobehavioral mechanisms to excessive alcohol use and problems, including AUD, and to the development of clinically efficacious interventions.((Batman & Miles, 2015)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4476605/]; )


As a graduate student, I developed preclinical models of cue-triggered motivation for alcohol5â€“7 and memory reconsolidation-based treatment strategies for its persistent attenuation.8 As a postdoctoral fellow, I retrained for clinically-relevant neuroscience research with human subjects so that I could directly advance efforts to translate between the non-human animal and human laboratory, and ultimately, between the human laboratory and the clinic. I am well positioned to conduct this needed translational research, having been trained in both preclinical nonhuman animal and human laboratory approaches to addiction neuroscience. As an early-stage new investigator with a demonstrated potential for NIH funding, I am fully committed to translational efforts in the neuroscience of addiction, a work that I strongly believe can contribute not only to the development of new treatments for AUD and other substance use disorders but also to our understanding of their etiology.
