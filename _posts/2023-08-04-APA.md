## APA Division 06 - Society for Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology 
### Top-Down and Bottom-Up Impacts of Alcohol on the Developing Brain 
#### Roberto Cofresi - Top-Down Inhibitory Control Over Bottom-Up Behavioral Approach Impulses Triggered by Alcohol 

Roberto Cofres√≠ presented behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) evidence for increased difficulty exerting top-down inhibitory control over bottom-up behavioral approach impulses triggered by alcohol beverage cues. This research includes emerging adults who report lower sensitivity to the acute effects of alcohol, which is a risk factor for heavy/hazardous alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. He will be sharing an update to some of his recently published research in which he observed behavioral and EEG evidence for conflict between top-down behavioral response control goals and bottom-up alcohol cue-induced approach motivation among heavy drinking/high-risk underage drinkers in late adolescence/early emering adulthood. The key event-related potential (ERP) in the research presented is the frontal or conflict N2/N450, which seems to reflect electrical activity in the anterior cingulate and/or medial prefrontal cortices. This research has vital translational implications for prevention efforts aimed at shifting behavioral responses to alcohol in adolescents with the larger goal of preventing alcohol use disorder in adulthood. Links to prevention research including implications on adolescent development including related to motivation to use alcohol will be shared with attendees.
